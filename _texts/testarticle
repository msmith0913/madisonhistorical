# Alhambra Grain and Feed

---

Alhambra Grain & Feed opened in 1919 as a customer-owned, cooperative grain elevator in Alhambra, which opened a second grain elevator in Marine in 1950. In 1945, the Alhambra location expanded and began production as the first cooperative soybean processing mill in Illinois. By 1960, the business grew to more than 1,200 members, served more than 2000 farmers within a 200-square-mile radius, and functioned as a community meeting center for the town. The Illinois Grain Corporation (IGC) took over the business in 1961 due to a shortfall in accounts found during a government audit of their inventory.  Alhambra Grain & Feed was sold to Madison Service Company in 1962, which then merged with M & M Service Company in 2011. As of 2018, both original locations are still in operation as a cooperation, but as part of the M & M Service Company.

A grain elevator is used to store grains. A cooperative grain elevator is when a group of investors, usually farmers, pool their money or other resources together to build a grain elevator which they then share. A group of citizens and farmers who recognized a need for a cooperative grain elevator opened Alhambra Grain & Feed in 1919.((“Alhambra Grain and Feed Company,” in Alhambra, Illinois Sesquicentennial, 1849-1999 (Shawnee Mission, Kansas: Kes-Print, 1999), 45.)) Their first board of directors were elected on April 3, 1919. Hug Construction company of Highland built the Alhambra elevator.((Ibid.))  Alhambra Grain & Feed began operating a second grain elevator in Marine in 1950.((“Alhambra Grain Co. Short $85,000; IGC to Take Over,” Alton Evening Telegraph, January 23, 1961, p. 6  (accessed February 3, 2018).)) The Alhambra location sponsored a local ladies bowling team for more than twelve years and was often used as a meeting place for various local organizations, such as the 4-H Club, American Legion Auxiliary, and the Home Bureau.
